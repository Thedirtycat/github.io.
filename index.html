    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline"> English Audio - Hereford (2009)</h3>

<p> I worked at English Audio for 3 months where my duties were to help customers
  to choose Hi-Fi equipment or TVs. I also had to answer phone calls from customers
   whilst in the shop too. My other main role was to go out on site with the other
   members of staff and help install speakers and other sound equipment as well as
    things like TV's. Other minor duties were cleaning the shop and and tidying
    up out the back of the shop.

<h3> Amey - Hereford ( Febuary 2010 - August 2010) </h3>

<p> I managed to get a 6 month contract with Amey through the job centre.
   My duties when I first started were to change the bins in Hereford and also pick
    up the litter in different areas around Hereford. After two days I was asked to
     help in another section of the company which involved filling up salt bins and
     salting and gritting the roads in the winter and cutting the grass around
     Herefordshire in the summer. I enjoyed this section of the company and they let
      me stay helping with these duties for the duration of my six month contract.
      At the end of my contract they wanted to keep me on as well as the two other
      people on the same contract but they said unfortunatly due to government cuts
      that they would not be able to.

<h3> Wyvern Business Systems( October 2010 - May 2014) </h3>
<p>
  A few months after my job at Amey I found a Job working at Wyvern Business Systems
  working in the Builds department. My duties there involved building tower PC's and
   installing software on them as well as installing software on laptops and Macs.
    Occasionally I was asked to do deliveries and setups of the computers around the
    midlands and to deliver computers to a depot in Birmingham. In the last year I have
    helped the technical department with repairs of laptops, tower PC's and Macs which
    could be anything from running stress tests to changing components. This did involve
     some data entry as we had to keep all the serial numbers in the database and I also
     took on the role of taking all the paper work and scanning it into the system as the
      company had decided to try and go paperless. I also had to communicate with people
      in other departments often to solve issues regarding software or hardware we were
      providing to the customers. Occasionally I had to supervise the department if our
      supervisor was away which involved solving problems within the department and
      delegating work to people. Also while supervising I was required to take phones calls
      from colleagues on site and help resolve an issue they might have.

<h3> Appen(Started 2015) </h3>
<p>
  The job I currently do is working online from home for an American company called Appen.
  It involves giving the company feedback on searches to help improve the algorithms used by
   some big companies like Ebay and Google. I have been doing this for about a year now but
   as sometimes the hours are limited therefore I would like to look for other work to increase my income.
</p>

<h3> Other work experience </h3>
<p>
  Previously I did a fitness instructor course and I did some voluntary work in a local gym in Hereford
  and also I did some voluntary work at the Halo gym for a while.
  I have helped on a friends chicken farm and occasionally assisted the tennis coach at Whitecross Tennis
 Club with summer/Easter tennis courses. I have also given one to one guitar lessons in the past.

            <p>


        I have some experience in quite a few different areas but I think IT has always been something that interests me and I have always spent a lot of time around them since I was quite young.
        My last job before my current job was in IT at Wyvern Business Systems but was mainly installing software and building computers. I later did have some experience with repairing laptops as well.
        Since being made redundant due to Wyvern Business Systems struggling to make profit I decided maybe I should persue IT as a career but the only jobs I could really apply for
        where I had some relevant skills were IT help desk type jobs. Recently I have had a good think about what path I should be taking and decided I should maybe go down a different
        career path as an IT help desk job isnt really my ideal job. I decided to try to do what my cousin did and learn web design and learn some different programming languages as
        I have seen how much he has progressed even though he was self taught and started off with no qualifications.
        It seems like it would be a good choice for me as I do really enjoy problem solving and enjoy doing something where I have to use my brain. I also like the fact there is a huge amount to learn
        and you can go down so many different paths with it.

        So far these last few months I have been learning HTML and CSS which I did previously learn the basics of a few years ago. I have also learned the basics of Javascript and also
        learned Jquery. I did read through the basics of PHP too but only know the basics. The latest thing I have been learning is bootstrap 4.
